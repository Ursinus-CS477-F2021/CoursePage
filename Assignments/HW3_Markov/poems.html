			Poetic Statement: Markov Hybrids (Breaking SpongeBad)

1.) It is growth, then decay, then transformation. It’s the government, jack. Did you see my underwear! Now that we're men, I changed my underwear!

2.) 50-years I spent like that. I have spent my whole life scared, frightened of things that you’ll come to learn about me in the box?

3.) No! I am the one who knocks! A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you get, like, zero douchebags? What if this is first grade!

4.) There are some things that you’ll come to learn about me in the next few days. But just know that the best thing about secrets is telling someone else your secret collection of secrets, secretely.

5.) There are some things that you’ll come to learn about me in the next few days. But just know that we're men, I changed my underwear!

6.) You do, call Saul. Don't you? Patrick?
