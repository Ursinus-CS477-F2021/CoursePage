                                    There are two variables that will affect how you apply the <a href = "#rules">rules</a> when you fill in <code>updateInfections</code>:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><b><code>dist</code>:</b>  If an uninfected person <code>i</code> is less than this amount away in both its x coordinate <b>and</b> its y coordinate to an infected person <code>j</code>, then person <code>i</code> becomes infected.</li>

                                            <li><b> <code>recovery_time </code>:</b> If an infected person has been long for this amount of time, then they are recovered.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        
                                        There are three arrays that are passed into this method that have as many rows/elements as there are people:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b><code>X</code></b>: A <code>num_people x 2</code> array of the positions of each person.  The x coordinates are in the first column, and the y coordinates are in the second column.</li>
                                            <li><b><code>states</code>:</b> An array of all peoples' states (the constants INFECTED/UNINFECTED/RECOVERED).  For example,<BR><code>states[0] = INFECTED</code><BR> would set the person at index 0 to be infected, and<BR> <code>if(states[i] == RECOVERED):</code><BR> would check to see if the i<sup>th</sup> person had recovered.</li>
                                            <li><b><code>time_sick</code>:</b> An array storing the amount of hours that each person has been sick.  If the person has yet to be infected, this number is 0.  If the person has recovered, this number should stay fixed at <code>recovery_</code></li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Your job is to update the array of <code>states</code> and the array <code>time_sick</code> for all people, based on their current state, their position, and the recovery time.
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>You should have a loop that loops through all of the people.  You may assume that all of the arrays have the same length</li>
                                        <li>This assignment is actually quite similar to the <a href = "../HW4_NBodyProblem">N-Body Problem</a>, so you can use that as a reference.  There, you checked every pair of bodies against each other to compute gravity.  Here, you're checking every pair of people against each other to see if one should infect the other</li>
                                        <li>The <code>np.abs()</code> function for the absolute value may come in handy when you're determining if two x coordinates or two y coordinates are within <code>dist</code>.</li>
                                        <li>For people who are uninfected, you will need a nested loop or an array operation to check all other people to see if they are close enough to someone who is infected.</li>
                                        <li>Don't forget to add one to the amount of time an infected person has been sick</li>
                                        <li>You don't need to do anything to people who have already recovered.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2><a name = "examplegrid">Example 0: Grid Example</a></h2>
                                    <p>
                                        To warm us up, let's consider an example of 6 points on a grid, with a recovery time of 100, and then look at the corresponding arrays that are passed to the <code>update_infections</code> method.  The example grid is as follows:
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <img src = "ExampleGrid.svg">
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        From this, we see that we have the following groups of dots (where the numbers in the dots represent how long those dots have been infected)
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Three infected dots at locations (1, 2), (2, 6), and (4, 7).  They have each been infected for 11 hours, 17 hours, and 24 hours, respectively.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Two uninfected dots at locations (1, 5) and (7, 5)
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                One dot at location (4, 4), which is recovered because it had already been infected for 100 hours.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        From this, the arrays that the <code>update_infections</code> method receives should look as follows (NOTE: They are in no particular order, but in this example I have put them in the order that I described them above)

                                        Finally, let's look at an example of the distance computation.  Let's consider the infected person at location (2, 6) and the uninfected person at location (5, 7).  The distance between the two is

                                        \[ |2-5| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

                                    <h2>Example 1: Everyone Moving</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        As an example, let's consider this code which is currently at the bottom of <code>COVID19.py</code>

                                        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: python"><![CDATA[
                                            num_people = 1000
                                            num_moving = num_people
                                            num_hours = 24*120
                                            res = 200
                                            recovery_time = 24*14

                                            simulate_pandemic(num_people, num_moving, num_hours, res, recovery_time, draw)

                                        In this example, every single person in a population of 1000 people is moving.  People who are uninfected are drawn as blue dots, people who are infected are drawn as larger red dots, and people who were infected but who have recovered are drawn as magenta dots.  The simulation will look something like this (although it will be random every time)

                                        The code pops up with the following plot at the end, which shows how many people were in each of the three states at each hour:

                                        As we can see both in the simulation and in the graph, the number of infections explodes very quickly.

                                    <h2>Example 2: Only 20% Moving</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        As another example, let's consider a scenario in which only 200 out of 1000 of people are moving

                                        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
                                            num_people = 1000

                                            num_hours = 24*120
                                            res = 200
                                            recovery_time = 24*14

                                        The video simulation then looks more like this:

                                        The code pops up with the following plot at the end for the above example:
                                    </p>

                                        As we can see both in the simulation and in the graph, the number of infections does not grow nearly as quickly, and the total number of people who are infected stays relatively flat.  This is why overall "social distancing" leads to "flattening the curve.  Even if some people do not follow the rules, it still keeps the number of cases manageable, and this can buy us valuable time to investigate vaccines and to study the illness.
